You are to create a guessing game static method in which the following happens.

  1.  Have the program welcome them to the game by name.
  2.  Have the program explain the rules.
  3.  Have the program ask the user what is the max number they want the range to be between.  For example, if I say 400, the game will then have a range of 1 - 400 to pick a random number from.
  4.  Have the program randomly generate the number.
  5.  Use a loop that will allow the user 5 attempts to guess the correct number.  BONUS: Create an if/else/ statement that will allow more guesses the higher the range.  (i.e. 5 for 1-100, 7 for 1-200 etc.)
  6.  Each time a guess is made, the program should reply with one of the following three responses:
    A. That guess was too high
    B. That guess was too Low
    C. Congrats you correctly guessed the number in ____ guesses.
  7.  If they run out of attempts. Tell them what the number was.
  

  BONUS - Create code that when the game is over, the player has the ability to play the game again.
